The A* (A-Star) search algorithm is a path-finding algorithm with many uses, including Artificial Intelligence for games. 
The search builds the route from tile to tile until it reaches the goal. To help choose the best possible tile the algorithm will 
use an equation that takes into account the distance from the tile to the goal and the cost of moving to that tile.

Equation used in this implementation is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|

You can clone it and import as existing maven project into your IDE (preferably Eclipse)

#Features of this implementation 

* You can run the jar from the command line as 
			
			<location>\Astar\jar> java -jar Astar-0.0.1.jar
  
  Or you can run the com.multichoice.RunAstar.java
 
* You can specify an input file as 
			
			-f {filename}
  
  if not specified it will look for map.txt in the jar folder(if running jar file) 
  or it will look for map.txt in the target folder (if running from IDE).
  
* You can disable diagonal movement by adding 
			
			-d
  
  By default diagonal movement is enabled.
  
* It is an executable jar file, just double click if there is a map.txt in the jar folder.

* Output file will be in the 'out' folder
  Depending on how you are running, it'll be in the jar or target folder.
  
* Output file name will be [providedFileName]-out.txt 
  Eg: if input file is map23.txt
      output will be map23-out.txt
      
#Drawbacks of this algorithm.

* Input file should be in rectangular 2D matrix format.

* No blank spaces can be allowed
